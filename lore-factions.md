**spoiler alert**.  Do not read this document if you have no intention of contributing to the project and do not want your play experience spoiled.

This document will outline deep design concepts and lore for existing and planned factions, both human and alien.  Due to the infrequency of updates to design docs, I will not be distinguishing from what is planned for addition and what is already in the game; if something noted here is inconsistent with content in the game, it is worth checking with core developers to get an idea of which direction we plan to go in.

## CDDA-Earth Native Human Factions

### Free Merchants

"A conglomeration of entrepreneurs and businessmen that stand together to hammer-out an existence through trade and industry."


**Description**: The Free Merchants are the remnants of "6 busloads of office workers and soccer moms" after the courageous people died fighting zombies.  The survivors want to fortify their evacuee center of a base and survive as a trading hub.

They have a lifeboat mentality at this point, and their lifeboat is full.  They are not charitable or nice and they pretty much require that people be able to pull their own weight or be abandoned.

**Structure**: The upper floor of the Evac Center is staffed by the few remaining combat capable people, while the rest live in the basement.

They're nominally a democracy on a town hall model, though currently there's an emergency manager for the first year or two post-Cataclysm.

**Goals**: Survive through trade.

**Size**: 60-160+ people?

**Attitudes**: Allied to the Old Guard as the last remnants of military force and organized government.  The Tacoma Commune is an allied off-shoot.  Trades with the Robofac, random scavengers, God's Chosen, the Great Library, the Campus, the Brotherhood of the Tentacle, Strongarm Survivalists, Marloss Evangelists, and Fence Men.  Preyed on by the Hell's Raiders.

Opposed to Mycus, triffids, zombies, and nether creatures, though has no ability to take the fight to them and can barely defend itself against zombie hordes.

Mildly anti-mutant.  Neither for or against augmentation.  Doesn't quite get that the Marloss Evangelists are mutants.

**Bases**: Controls an evacuee center.  The Tacoma Commune is a farm project on a nearby ranch.

**Trade/Economics**: Has a robust internal economy, using specifically stamped US greenbacks as scrip.  Honors their scrip, however it comes to them.  Will buy eCards at a huge discount and sell them at a significant discount.  Will buy money bundles at a premium (compared to their value as paper).

**Missions** (fairly complete): Deal with monsters and bandits, get parts for the center, help the Tacoma Commune.

### Hell's Raiders

*"The largest gang of hooligans and bandits that preys upon other survivors.  Even if you have no gear, there is always a need for slaves and fresh meat."*

**Description**: The Hell's Raiders are a collection of smaller gangs, some of which existed before the Cataclysm.  Much of the membership was already willing to commit armed robbery or more violent crimes, and their attitudes haven't changed now that law enforcement is defunct and zombies roam the land.

**Structure**: Most gangs are led by a boss with an aptitude for leadership and violence.  The members consist of former criminals, along with some desperate people who figure having a rough bunch of thugs on your side is a good survival strategy.  Slaves round out the gang structure and perform menial labor, gardening, and other low risk but necessary work.

The gang leaders themselves are led by a junta of fairly nasty mutants and augmentees who view themselves as Nietzschean ubermensch with a Will to Power (not all of them take this view explicitly, but that's the general attitude).  They are the post-Human rulers of a brave new world.  Psychopathy is common, and at least a few are post-Threshold mutants with sapiovore.  At least some of these people were involved in creating the Cataclysm, though not intentionally.  Some of them are looking for other post- and trans-humans to serve as lieutenants.

**Goals**: The junta leadership seeks power and are willing to do what it takes to get it.  In their zero-sum worldview, other powerful factions mean less power for them, so they seek to destabilize the other factions, but they also seek to control or destroy monster factions like the Mycus, the triffids, and the mi-go.

Most gang members want to survive and be comfortable.

**Size**: Dozens of gangs.  Gangs range from 2-3 people to 40+.  The leadership junta has 4-7 members and fights among itself with some regularly and/or gets betrayed by ambitious underlings.

**Attitudes**: Hostile to the Old Guard, as the other remaining powerful human faction.  Individual gangs prey on the Free Merchants, Tacoma Commune, Farm Survivalists, Strongarm Survivalists, Gods Chosen, the Campus, and the Great Library.  Performs limited trade with the Robofac.  Generally friendly with Fence Men.  The leadership despises the Neo Natives but individual gangs sometimes trade with them.  Some gangs prey on the BOTT, but the leadership would prefer to recruit the more promising members.  Marloss Evangelists sometimes poach individual gangs or even junta members, but the junta can't quite decide if Marloss berries are a path to power or not.

Generally pro-mutant and pro-augmentation; post-Threshold mutants or powerful augmentees are more likely to be recruited than enslaved.

Generally hostile to the Mycus, triffids, zombies, and nether cults.

**Bases**: Individual gangs prefer to take over existing buildings, especially prepper cabins, LMOE shelters, apartments, or military outposts and bunkers.  Some gangs have built forts.  Any given lead has a base in a LMOE shelter, semi-functioning lab, or military outpost.

**Trade/Economics**: Has a fairly robust internal economic system based on precious metals, but no formal currency within the first year.  Favored allies (the Fence Men basically) can also trade gold/silver with them.  Other people get promissory notes to round out barter, with no guarantee that the promissory notes will be honored in the future.  The double-dealing nature of the Hell's Raiders will cause them problems in the future.

**Missions**: Spy on Free Merchant and Tacoma Commune caravans, subvert the Old Guard, destroy fungal infestations, destroy triffids.

**Note**: Current members of the Hell's Raiders shoot the player on sight, so if they're going to be developed as a real faction, that needs to change.

### Old Guard

"The remains of the federal government.  The extent of their strength is unknown but squads of patrolling soldiers have been seen under their banner."


**Description**: The Old Guard claims to be the remnants of the US Federal government, with an armada of ships in the Atlantic Ocean and a few walled off cities near the coast.  In practice, there's a pair of Old Guard agents at the Evacuee Center working with the Free Merchants, and a few squads caught in the Necropolis.

The Old Guard, on the surface, seems like the "good" faction, but they're making claims they can't support and are stretched way too thin.  Their leadership also caused the Cataclysm, so it's not obvious why anyone would want to put them back in control.

**Structure**: Practically speaking, the Old Guard is a support network that can provide limited supplies and goods to independent contractors and Federal Marshals who perform necessary tasks.

**Goals**: Undo the Cataclysm, or failing that, re-establish civilization under the Old Guard's control.

**Size**: Theoretically, tens of thousands of people.  Practically, a few dozen.

**Attitudes**: Friendly to any organization that accepts Old Guard guidance and seeks to stabilize the Cataclysm.  They're on good terms with the Free Merchants, Tacoma Commune, God's Chosen, the Great Library, and the Campus.  Opposed to the Fence Men, Hell's Raider, Neo-Natives, and Bravo Deserters.  Wants to establish control over the Strongarm Survivalists, Farm Survivalists, and Robofac, and would be willing to use force to settle the issue.  To the extent that the Old Guard understands that Marloss Evangelists are a front for the Mycus, they're against them.

Completely neutral on the subject of mutants and augmentees.

Explicitly hostile to the Mycus, triffids, zombies, and nether cults.

**Bases**: The Old Guard has outposts at the Evacuee Center.

**Trade/Economics**: The Old Guard is the US government, and thus thinks that trade should be handled via US greenbacks (money bundles) and eCash.  The reality of the Cataclysm means that there's been 1000% inflation, so while they technically honor eCash, they don't pay much for it.

**Missions** (partially complete): Deal with bandits, investigate labs, rescue soldiers from the Necropolis, bring Farm/Strongarm Survivalists into the fold.

**Resources**: The key resource of the Old Guard is their fleets.  Due to the isolated, regimented and self-sufficient nature of naval vessels (including merchant vessels), there was a vastly higher survival rate among in-transit ships than among the general population. While the fleets took losses from many sources, there are a number of fully-crewed and operational ships, including some very large vessels. This resource comes at a great cost however, the manpower required to operate and maintain these vessels accounts for the majority of the Old Guard population, and the resources they require is an unsustainable drain on the faction.

**Development Direction**: The major challenge facing the old guard immediately after the Cataclysm is extracting as much value as possible from the fleet while decommissioning it. Each remaining ship can either be operated as a combat vessel at great resource cost (food, equipment, provisions, fuel and manpower) or decommissioned to provide a core around which a community can be built. Even the smallest ship has a large diesel engine that can be configured as a generator, as well as secured storage facilities, sleeping berths, stocks of ammunition and weapons, and various facilities such a cooking, machine shops and medical facilities. The expected trajectory is that the Old Guard recruits survivors to act as settlers, and once they have a sufficient number and have located a strategic location for a settlement, they establish a settlement there and decommission a ship to act as the core of the settlement. In parallel with this decommissioning effort, the Old Guard would prioritize establishing a provisional and then permanent government to maintain their legitimacy.

One possible ongoing campaign for the Old Guard might be clearing and forming a permanent zombie-free zone on Nantucket, then launching a similar campaign to attempt to retake Martha's Vineyard. Player/mercenary involvement in the Martha's Vineyard campaign would be an option.

**Steady State**: Eventually the majority of the fleet is decommissioned as the cores of new settlements scattered across the eastern seaboard. A remaining skeleton fleet, operating with skeleton crews might continue to patrol the Atlantic coast to provide support to these settlements. The faction at this point is transitioned into expanding their control and solidifying their holdings. Settlements built around a decommissioned ship have a massive head start compared to most settlements, but at the same time Old Guard settlers would be the least equipped among the factions to adapt to the new realities of founding an inshore settlement.

### Tacoma Commune

*"An outpost started by the Free Merchants to provide a source of food and raw materials."*

**Description**: The Free Merchants send their idle hands to work at the Tacoma Commune.  Hard work as a subsistence farmer at the Commune is unpleasant, but it's better than starving to death at the Evac Center, and Commune workers get first dibs on any food produced.

Over time, the interests of the Commune and Merchants are going to diverge, and the Commune workers are going to be less and less interested in paying taxes to the Free Merchant.

**Structure**: The foreman and crop overseer run the joint.

**Goals**: Build a small village at a ranch.

**Size**: 2 people initially but increases over time.

**Attitudes**: A colony of the Free Merchants that initially takes their attitudes.

**Bases**: Controls a ranch.

**Trade/Economics**: Uses Free Merchant scrip for commerce, with substantial black market trading in cut logs and healthcare services.

**Missions** (fairly complete): acquire supplies necessary to expand the commune, help build the commune, defend caravans to the evac center.

## Extradimensional and Alien Factions


### "The Blob", XE-037

**Discovery**: 
The blob came to CDDA-Earth as the consequence of scientists exploring dimensions without knowing the risks.  There may have been some encouragement from otherdimensional forces.  See [the Background document](./lore-background.md) for full details.

**General Description**:  
The Blob is a dispersed intelligence vastly greater than anything conceivable to a human mind. To it, we are as significant as individual cells of a body. Human researchers obtained samples of the Blob. While XEDRA experimented on it, it passively observed them and then decided Earth was a worthwhile location to add to its dispersed body. So, with less effort than a human takes to scratch its ear, the Blob rolled into our world and made us part of it.  Individual samples of XE-037 are not composed of matter as we understand it, and can only be detected by the gaps it leaves in real matter where it displaces it.  Really, it is all one vast single interconnected unit weaving in and out of undetectable extra dimensions.

**Inscrutable**:
The Blob, as a concept in writing, should be thought of less like an antagonist or a character and more like a set of rules and a force of nature.  None of the direct interacting organisms in the game world are even particularly aware of its existence. Those few that are aware that XE-037 exists do not realize that it is a vast interdimensional organism. This information might *never* be directly revealed in game.

**Tips for writing an inscrutable mad world**
Many find the idea of an inscrutable god consuming our world to be difficult to write.  The following are some useful tips to consider when wondering about the blob's motivations, but remember: these are not canon, they are ways to wrap your mind around something. Were you to study the blob, somehow, you'd find that all these are incorrect.

- the blob pits different factions of itself against each other to find the strongest.  Mutants versus zombies.  Survivors versus mutants.  Netherum "mercenaries" against its own parts.  Why?  No one can say, but perhaps it seeks the most ideal appendages by doing so.
- the blob consumes not people, but entire universes for energy.  It is digesting our universe.  The timescales it cares about are on the order of hundreds to thousands, maybe even millions or billions of years.  It will slowly expand its corruption out from our world and devour everything in this plane of existence.
- the blob is unintelligent.  Really, it is very intelligent, but it is an intelligent being that is in another room playing video games, and we are the leftover crust of a sandwich it ate a while ago, sitting on the counter.  It cares so little about us that it may as well not be considered to think.  The only time this would change is if its grasp on our world was somehow threatened, which should never happen in the scope of CDDA.

**What does it want**?  
The Blob is vast. It cannot be communicated with nor reasoned with. The most we could possibly manage would be to annoy it enough that it would reach out and slap us, and that would be that. Far preferable would be for us to convince it to leave us alone - which really isn't that hard, since it doesn't really care about the human survivors whatsoever. It is in many ways analogous to a Lovecraftian elder god, but one that has already woken up, devastated the world, and moved on to other things.

**Quest options**  
With the Blob itself, there really aren't any. You can't convince Azathoth to go away and leave us alone, it's not a thing. Zombies cannot be cured; their brains are mush, they are dead. Perhaps sufficient purifier could clear your own XE-037 infestation for a while, but unless you plan to drink treated water the rest of your life, it's going to come back, and what have you really accomplished? Survivors' best hope is to get the Blob to leave them alone, which is mostly wants to do anyway.

**Ubiquitous, reanimatory, mutagenic**  
See [Effects of Blob Infection](#effects-of-blob-infection) for more information.

The groundwater is infected with XE-037. Every creature on Earth is contaminated. In larger mammals, this contamination allows XE-037 to reanimate us after we die, becoming zombies. In insects, it causes mutation to larger forms.

The XE-037 contaminating all living things is not the Blob, any more than a transistor is a computer processor. This basic Blob biomatter can be coerced into causing mutations in infected targets (i.e. anyone), using mutagen.

**Frequently Asked Question #1: Can I kill Azathoth**
No.  You cannot kill the blob.  Further, and more important for writers to understand: *the blob is not the antagonist of the game*.  It is the setting.  The blob is not trying to kill the player.  The player *is part of the blob*, just as much as the zombies are.

### The Mycus

**Description**  
The Mycus loves you, and it just wants to be together forever.

If the Blob is a mugger in an alley that hits you over the head and takes your stuff, the Mycus is a creepy guy with a candy van that tries to tempt you over to it.

**Goals**  
The Mycus' goals are actually rather similar to the Blob. It wants our world and our people to become part of it. Its mind, however, seems to be more suited to understanding the individual, at least somewhat. If it can't make you part of it the easy way - by filling your body with spores and using you as soil - it will try to make you part of it another way. Have you tried this fruit? It's delicious, and provides all the nutrients you need to live. Try another, go ahead. We can make all you need. Don't you want to come with us now?

Didn't the fruit work? Hm. Perhaps we'll need to try something else. I know we can find a way to be together.

**For Survivors**  
It's dangerous and tempting to think the Mycus can be reasoned with. As interactions with NPCs become increasingly complicated it is likely the Mycus can play a big role there. It's the sort of intelligence that would send a sleeper agent into your base and try to put spores into the water. It's the sort of entity that is really tempting to build cults around. After all, if you join us, we will provide for you.

**Notes**:   
Philosophically speaking... is joining the Mycus all that bad? I guess it depends how much you value individuality. One could see the Blob and the Mycus representing opposite ends of a transhuman spectrum. The Blob is cold and uncaring, but offers freedom. You can use it to become anything you can imagine. The Mycus will help you, but you must give yourself up to it completely.

Also you must like mushrooms a lot.

### Triffids

**Description**  
Triffids resemble Earth plants in morphology, on a surface and cellular level.  However, in terms of physiology and anatomy, they are not plants at all.  

### The Netherum

**Description**  
Triffids resemble Earth plants in morphology, on a surface and cellular level.  However, in terms of physiology and anatomy, they are not plants at all.  

### The Exodii

See [the Technology document](./technology.md) for more details on how Exodii technology works, both practically and (non-canonically) some of the theory ideas for how it could function.

### Mi-Go

**Discovery**  
The mi-go have been known to humans, and vice versa, for some time.  At least a few specimens have been captured from crashed ships.  See [the Background document](./lore-background.md) for some details.

**General Description**  
Mi-go are extraterrestrial, and possibly extradimensional, aliens.  They have a few different subtypes, which may represent castes or subspecies or simply professions.  All of them parrot speech, and seem to be able to parrot shared experiences, but this is not completely universal.  It is assumed they either have a hive mind, or access to some sort of shared network consciousness.

**Goals on Cataclysmic Earth**  
Before the Cataclysm, mi-go occasionally swung by Earth to observe its inhabitants.  Now, with our governments fallen and our planet on the precipice of complete extinction, they are here to salvage what they can of use.  To them, this means capturing as much of our remaining biodiversity in the form of slaves and samples to be shipped off-world for study.  Some samples will be disassembled for easy transport, but some live specimens will be sent back whole.

**Mi-go Culture, Technology, and Opinions on Humans**  
Most of this should remain strictly behind the scenes. Mi-go have an advanced spacefaring and dimension crossing culture focused on rigidly engineered biotechnology.  They consider technology that is constructed, rather than grown, to be something of a religious anathema and are strongly opposed to it.  Despite this, the mi-go would not consider themselves overtly hostile to humanity as a whole; to them, most humans have been perfectly reasonable to the mi-go and vice versa.  To the mi-go, cutting up a captured specimen to see how it works is the species equivalent of a cautious handshake, and they would take no offence.  What would bother them heavily is a knowledge of how mi-go biology has been used to design compact bionic modules, but it is unlikely they have an intimate understanding of the specifics of this.

Mi-go technology is inscrutable to humans.  The very principles of their devices are wholly alien and do not make any sense to us.  It is likely they feel similarly about our stuff, if they even had a mind to study it - which they largely don't, seeing our metal trinkets as disgusting garbage. 

Mi-go do not seem to be susceptible to the effects of the blob, but this is more likely to be due to their ability to fine-tune their own biology than due to any inherent immunity.

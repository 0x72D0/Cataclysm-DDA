Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world.  Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world.  Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge.  Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have…


# Story

The world ended.  You don't know what caused it, but suddenly everywhere was being overrun with monsters of all kinds.  Now only a tiny fraction of humanity is alive, the dead fill the cities, and worse things are stirring in the wilderness.

Civilization is gone, but maybe you can survive.  Maybe you can find others.

## Style & Structure

Storytelling in CDDA should be fragmented and emergent, to simulate the idea that nobody really knows what happened.  What people know is what they experienced, which was random and chaotic.  There were no news broadcasts informing survivors that a hostile interdimensional force had decided to conquer Earth; one day, the dead started walking, and that was sure weird; while we were all getting used to that, the world broke open and creatures from nightmares moved among us eating people and smashing stuff.  It wasn't much fun, and nobody's quite sure how it happened.

Those with the best knowledge of what happened are dead.  Some of them left notes.  Those notes should be hard to get.

Information about what really went down might be made contradictory, because it's unlikely anyone has a full and clear picture of it.  Much of what is regurgitated as fact is supposition, theory, or sheer crazy ravings.


Also, everyone has PTSD.

## Background Information

**Spoiler alert**.  This section will contain many lore spoilers for elements that are meant to be mysterious or hard to learn in game.

**Summary**:

There was an arms race to develop transhumans.  In the process, the US government discovered alternate dimensions and obtained a sample called "XE-037", a mysterious black goo that was able to reanimate the dead and cause miraculous targeted phenotype mutations.  XE-037 turned out to be intelligent - vastly so - and escaped, contaminating the groundwater and causing an enormous zombie outbreak.  As this spiraled out of control, Earth became the target of a multidimensional portal attack through which the Blob, the entity of which XE-037 is just a small part, took over our world.  Simultaneously, forces from other dimensions entered opportunistically as our dimensional fabric was destabilized.  This was the Cataclysm.

Things are a bit more stable now, but nobody is left alive to appreciate that.

For a detailed explanation of how the Cataclysm came to be, see [the Background document](./lore-background.md).

### Effects of Blob Infection

Every living thing on earth is infected by the blob.  In humans, passive blob infection has a few effects.  This has some serious ramifications for gameplay and storytelling.

**Increased Healing**
Blob infection means everyone heals more quickly from basic soft tissue injuries.  It doesn't affect immune systems and doesn't have as powerful an effect on broken bones.  It also doesn't allow regeneration… Not unless you die, first.

In-game this is an explanation for rapid player healing; note that this means that rapid healing is diegetic, ie.  characters in the game world are conscious of the fact that they heal much faster than before, and may comment on it.

**Mutation**
The Blob seems to somehow store a base state for the infected creature (purifier triggers it to revert to this state and can be thought of as a 'basic human' mutagen).  That base state can be copied and imposed on the blob by crafting mutagen that has been exposed to a target organism.  The blob also responds to radiation and certain other toxic challenges by sometimes causing random mutations.

Mutagens work in part by copying a particular creature's phenotype onto the blob, then merging that phenotype with the person consuming the mutagen.  Mutagens do *not* work by modifying the underlying genetics of the organism: they are epigenetic.

**Cognition**
The blob has a potent, albeit often subtle, effect on human cognition.

In about one quarter of the population, changes are basically unnoticeable.

For about half the population, the blob causes an increase in risk-taking behaviour, ranging from mild unsafe practices all the way to people attacking hordes of zombies with a stick.

The remaining quarter see a heavy increase in aggressive, violent behaviour, often completely out of character.  The worst of these, about 1/20 of the population, become "ferals", a form of living zombie.  These ferals actually contain a much higher concentration of blob, are not seen as hostile to zombies, and mutate naturally with time just as zombies do.  Ferals still maintain a degree of human intelligence, depending on how severely affected they are… Some can remember tool use, for example.  Ferals led to a great deal of confusion over whether the reports of the dead rising were true, as feral behavior is very similar to that of zombies.

"Blob psychosis" is an out of game term for the increased violence experienced by this quarter of the population.  Nobody in game calls it that.  Strictly speaking it's not a psychosis, but that term seems to have stuck in our game discussions.

#### Blob psychosis after the Cataclysm
Over time, most affected people acclimate and return to normal.  Some remain somewhat less risk-averse than before (eg players).  Those that tended towards high violence also drift back towards normal cognition slowly, although their actions and the memory of them likely leave them changed permanently.

True ferals are permanently altered.  Like all living humans, their numbers were severely thinned during the Cataclysm; the fact that they weren't targeted by zombies is balanced by the fact that they didn't make much effort to avoid confrontation with police and military forces.

**Ferals Now**
The majority of feral humans are difficult to distinguish from zombies.  They can grasp and use simple tools like clubs and melee weapons, and will avoid dangerous obstacles, open doors, and other very simple actions largely governed by motor memory, but that's about it.  These comprise around 1% of the zombie faction.

About a third of ferals remember more complex things.  These ferals might use complex tools properly, and would understand for example how to use a gun, activate a Hack, or put on a kevlar vest.  They lack forward thinking and executive reasoning, and would be unlikely to engage in complex tactics (they might know how to arm c4, but would not think to put it onto your base wall to blast a way in) but can nevertheless be extremely dangerous.  These comprise around 0.3% of the zombie faction.

A very dangerous tenth or so of ferals maintain most of their human intelligence.  They can use any tools they would have in life, can plan tactics, and can assess your weaknesses and use salvaged materiel to exploit them… Basically anything an NPC should be able to do.  Likely they can talk as well, although probably it would be difficult for them to be too deceptive.  These comprise about 1/1000 of the zombie faction.  Over time these will probably evolve into a variant living form of zombie Masters and become another nemesis level villain for the late game.  Feral Masters would be exceedingly rare, probably 1/10,000 or less, given the low odds of an intelligent feral living long enough to evolve.

Many of the Blob Avatars sent to earth were probably the equivalent to Feral Masters among their own species.
